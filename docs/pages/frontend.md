# Integrating the Frontend Code
As mentioned in Chapter 4.3 of the book, you can download the complete source code for the frontend of the application from this GitHub repository.
Integrate it into your version of the Business Partner Address Manager application as follows:
1. Download the [archive with the frontend source code](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-book/raw/master/docs/assets/address-manager.zip).
2. Create a folder called `address-manager` inside the folder `application/src/main/webapp` of your project.
3. Unzip the content of the archive into the newly created folder, that is, into `application/src/main/webapp/address-manager/`.
4. Proceed as described in Chapter 4.3.

Alternatively, you can find the source code of the frontend in the folder `application/src/main/webapp/address-manager/` when you checkout the `master` branch of the repository.
